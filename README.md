#  Pok√©mon Memory Card Game (Gotta Click 'Em All!)

A classic memory/click game implemented with React and Vite. The objective is to click on each Pok√©mon card exactly once per round. If you click a Pok√©mon you've already clicked in the current round, you lose. The cards are shuffled after every successful click to test your memory!
